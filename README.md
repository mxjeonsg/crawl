## Crawl
The social media where you cry for attention.

## Wtf? Why the name?
I don't know, I watch a lot of Twitter users just crawling
for attention, the Twitter users I respect the most over there
as ironically as sounds are artists, they're just doing their
business in peace, and I'd say it's the only thing Twitter does
well.

## So, you think you're making a Twitter killer?
Nah, more like a time killer.

## What technologies you used here?
+ For the backend:
 - C
 - JavaScript?
 - SQLite3
+ For the frontend:
 - JavaScript
 - Lua

## What are the plans for this software towards the future?
As of Tuesday, October 1st 2024 concerns, the planes are:
- Adding secondary functionability in Lua
- Add image/video/gif support
 - Use Face(R) bruh(TM) compression method
- Move to another database technology if bigger adoptions needs so.
- Move the web frontend UI to React/Tailwind instead of Vanilla.
 - I don't like neither, I prefer the vanilla way, but if I want to
   eat from the IT industry, I might learn all that crap.
